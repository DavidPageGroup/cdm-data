About this Directory and its Data
=================================


Limited Volume Size
-------------------

The disk space of this volume is limited to 200G and it is already about
75% full, so please use it conservatively and wisely.  I have asked for
it to be enlarged so that we have space to collaborate, store cleaned
data, etc.


Cleaned, Sorted, and Compressed Data
------------------------------------

I have created a version of the data that is sorted by study ID and
compressed.  This can make the data faster to access in many cases.  See
`sorted_data` and `sorted_data/CONTENTS.md` in particular for more
information.

Unfortunately, I realized that people do not have access to this data or
the vocabulary due to group membership issues.  Thus, access to this
data will have to wait until the volume is enlarged and I can copy
things down.


File Formats
------------

The formats of the files found here are described in
`sorted_data/CONTENTS.md` and in `tables.yaml`.


OMOP / CDM / Athena Vocabulary
------------------------------

The "vocabulary" (the names and concepts) needed to understand the codes
in this data I have provided in the `vocab` directory.  Information
about the vocabulary files can be found at
https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel/wiki.  The vocabulary contents
can be browsed online at http://athena.ohdsi.org/, and there is some
background information at https://www.ohdsi.org/analytic-tools/.

this data.
